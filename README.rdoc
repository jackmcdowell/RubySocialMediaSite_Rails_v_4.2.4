== README

To set up this application all that needs to be done is clone the repository and run rake db:migrate.
Then rails can be ran and everything should work.
Routes are incomplete so users need to be created at /users/sign_up before any posting is allowed, or things will likely break.
This is a demo program / work in progress.
